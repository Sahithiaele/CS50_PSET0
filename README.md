This project is a simple game developed for the CS50x course on edX. The game involves a ball bouncing when it touches the paddle. It is created using Scratch, a visual programming language developed by MIT.


## Introduction

Welcome to the Ball Bounce Game! This game is a part of the problem set for CS50x, designed to showcase your understanding of programming concepts using Scratch.

## How to Play

1. **Start**: Click the green flag to start the game.
2. **Controls**: Move the paddle using the arrow keys to prevent the ball from falling.
3. **Bounce**: The ball will bounce when it touches the paddle.
4. **Score**: Try to keep the ball bouncing for as long as possible to achieve a high score.

## Game Mechanics

The game is a classic ball and paddle interaction:

- The paddle is controlled by the arrow keys.
- The ball bounces when it touches the paddle.
- The game continues until the ball falls off the screen.

## Installation

To play the game, you need to have Scratch installed on your computer. Follow these steps:
